# Automark
```
  A program I wrote to create bordered, watermarked photos. I created this program because I wanted the watermarks
  for my artworks to have a standardized format.
  
  User provides:
    1) path to watermark with transparent background
    2) path to photograph to watermark and border
    3) desired size of watermark, as a percentage of 2)'s width
    4) hex color code of the watermark and border
    5) width of the border (px)
```
